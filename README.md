# User Finder
## This is the final challenge from Module 1 of IGTI Javascript Fullstack Developer Bootcamp.
The objective was to build an application to fetch users from a public API, manipulate its data and filter users from an expression provided.

Some assumptions:
* The search button must be disabled until there is some text in the field;
* The user will be able to filter data when typing at least one character in the input;
* The user can filter the data either by typing "Enter" or clicking the corresponding button;

This allowed to practice:
* Manipulate HTML elements;
* Stylize by CSS;
* Catch the elements reference by Javascript;
* Format value in Javascript;
* Make HTTP Requests;
* Use Async Functions;
* Use ES6+ resources (map, filter, reduce, arrow functions, and more);
